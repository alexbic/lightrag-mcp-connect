# Status: LightRAG MCP Gateway

**Updated:** 2026-07-21T19:50:00Z

## Summary
Managed backend mode is the current release track. The public connector repository owns both `mcp/app` and `gateway/app`; deployments should consume released versions from this repository instead of copying connector source into separate deployment repositories.

## Progress
- M1 Managed Backend Baseline: █████████░ 90%
- M2 Managed MCP Release: ██░░░░░░░░ 20%
- M3 Public Repository Polish: █████░░░░░ 50%
- M4 External LightRAG Proxy Mode: ░░░░░░░░░░ 0%

## Done
- Added managed workspace gateway.
- Implemented admin registry model: admin keys use `workspace_slug=NULL`, `is_admin=true`.
- Implemented workspace key isolation: normal keys are bound to one workspace.
- Simplified project structure to `gateway/app` and `mcp/app`.
- Renamed user-facing admin env to `LIGHTRAG_ADMIN_KEY`.
- Added project instruction files.
- Added recoverable task-state protocol for agents.
- Added task decomposition rule for large or risky work.
- Added skills/tools check rule before specialized work.
- Added fix-and-verification loop rule for agents.
- Verified MCP checks: 29 passed, mypy clean, black clean.
- Verified gateway checks: 8 passed, 1 skipped, mypy clean, black clean.
- Verified `deploy/docker-compose.gateway.yml`, `deploy/docker-compose.yml`, `deploy/docker-compose.full-example.yml`, and `deploy/docker-compose.traefik.yml` config.
- Verified `gateway/Dockerfile` build.
- Verified remote tag `v1.3.0` exists.

## In Work
- Managed backend release hardening and documentation pin refresh.
- Public MCP gateway-mode release preparation.

## Blockers
- None known for managed backend code.

## Next
- Finish the public managed gateway-aware MCP release.
- Finish the README and compose pin refresh for managed gateway mode.
- Keep `BACKLOG.md` and `STATUS.md` updated before and during future repository work so interrupted sessions can be resumed safely.
- Decompose future large tasks into independently testable backlog items before implementation.
- Check applicable skills/tools before manual specialized workflows; propose a reusable skill when a workflow repeats.
- Use the fix-and-verification loop before declaring future verification blockers.
